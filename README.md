# Tool_Booth
This is a small level Tool_Booth  System.
Description
This is a simple Java console-based Tollbooth Management System.
It counts the number of cars passing through the tollbooth and calculates the total cash collected from paying vehicles.
How It Works:
A paying car increases both the car count and the cash by 0.50 units.

A non-paying car only increases the car count.

The system keeps running until manually stopped (it doesn't exit after showing totals).
